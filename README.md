# Pictures-to-Obsidian-Daily-Notes
Uploads new pictures in your specified folder to Imgur and links them inside your markdown daily notes with a timestamp.  

# Introduction

For use with **Obsidian**, a *personal knowledge management system* that uses markdown files. 
If you use daily notes in outliner format to log the progress of your day, you might also want to link the pictures that you take throughout the day as well. I thought about having images upload directly to the Obsidian vault, but that would take up a lot of space, especially if you are using Obsidian Sync with attachments enabled. Alternatively, I decided to upload them via Imgur and have them linked to my notes. 

I chose to use Roam Research's default naming convention for daily notes, being: ==MMMM Do, YYYY==. This program will not work yet with any other date format. 
The program doesn't link images incrementally yet. If you run the program, it will link the most recent picture and then stop. Ideally, it should link pictures as they come up. That is the next step for me to work on. 

This would probably be better as an Obsidian Plugin, although I don't have the capabilities for it yet, so this is my workaround. 

To use, enter in your Obsidian vault path, image folder path, and your imgur client ID.
